# Rotary Position Embedding for Flax.

Implements the position embeddings from [RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864) for [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). [rotary-embedding-torch](https://github.com/lucidrains/rotary-embedding-torch) was used as a reference implementation.

Features:

* 1D (for sequence models) and 2D axial (for ViT) rotary embeddings.
* Learnable frequencies, including separate learnable frequencies per attention head.

## Usage
